need to direct parser to parse a whole "expression", not generate a program
every time. this way a single "expression" can be parsed out of a TokenTree
without the extra tokens after it being always interpretted as
"the next part of this toplevel program", preventing further parsing by
the next capture

literals in pattern matches, i.e. make captures special and allow any tokens

make the TokenTree a real tree, nest the groups
